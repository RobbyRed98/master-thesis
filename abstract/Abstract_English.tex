DB2Graph is a graph extension for IBM's relational database system DB2. The extension aims to combine the high performance and low memory usage of relational database systems with the ease of querying graph structures. The goal of the research of the thesis is to analyze for which use cases DB2Graph is suitable. For this purpose, it will be investigated to what extent DB2Graph and graph database differ from each other in their capabilities and resource usage. Furthermore, the effort required to configure and operate DB2Graph will be evaluated. It will be also examined whether DB2Graph can be expanded or customized. The final investigations deal with the possible future of DB2Graph.
