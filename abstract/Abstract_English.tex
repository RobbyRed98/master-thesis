The goal of this thesis is to analyze and compare the performance of Db2 Graph, a graph extension for the relational database system Db2, and Neo4j as a graph database system. In order to achieve the goal of the thesis, the performance of the two systems was determined using the Linkbench benchmark and the results obtained were evaluated. Only the reading operations of Linkbench are used for the measurements, since Db2 Graph only supports these as a graph extension. The results measured of the Linkbench benchmark have shown that the Neo4j graph database system has a significantly higher performance than Db2 Graph. Db2 Graph showed a lower performance than Neo4j in all measurements executed. This shows that Db2 Graph cannot keep up with the performance of Neo4j as a graph database system. However, this does not mean that the use of Db2 Graph as a graph extension for Db2 is not worthwhile.
